The analysis found that there were 18,765 healthy loans (class \"0\") and 619 high-risk loans (class \"1\"). This is not a very balanced dataset, as ideally we would see a far greater number of high-risk loans.\n",

    "Model Training: The dataset was split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function. Logistic regression models were trained on the training data using the LogisticRegression class from SKLearn.\n",

    "Model Evaluation: The trained models were used to make predictions on the testing data. The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as balanced accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. These metrics provided insights into the models' accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for both the \"0\" and \"1\" classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling: In the subsequent analysis, resampling techniques were applied to address the class imbalance in the dataset. The RandomOverSampler from the imbalanced-learn library was used to oversample the minority class (\"1\" class) to achieve a more balanced dataset.\n",

    "Based on the results, both the resampled model and original model show a high level of accuracy and demonstrate good performance in predicting both classes of loan risk. However, after completing an analysis from both models, the resampled model shows slightly higher accuracy (0.994) compared to the first model (0.952). Additionally, the resampled model achieves higher precision, recall, and F1-score for the minority class (\"1\" class), indicating a better ability to identify high-risk loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "When determining which model is the best, if the main objective is to achieve overall accuracy and balanced performance for both classes, the resampled model is recommended. It not only achieves high accuracy but also demonstrates improved precision, recall, and F1-score for the high-risk loans. This model would be suitable when both classes (\"0\" and \"1\") are equally important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, the resampled model more accurately identifies high-risk loans (\"1\" class), it performs better in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score for the minority class. This can be crucial in situations where correctly identifying high-risk loans is of paramount importance.Considering the slightly higher accuracy and improved performance for the minority class, the resampled model appears to be the preferred choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we should consider that rather than working with a robust dataset, we are relying on resampling to complete our analysis. We would likely have greater accuracy if we started with a more balanced dataset, and not relied on the resampling. Resampling can artificially balance the dataset, but it does not address the underlying class imbalance issue in the real world. The model's performance may not generalize well to unseen data from the same problem domain, where class imbalance persists. Finding a more balanced dataset from the start can help mitigate these limitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to carefully consider the trade-offs between resampling and obtaining a more balanced dataset. If possible, collecting or acquiring a balanced dataset in the first place is preferred. However, if obtaining a balanced dataset is not feasible, resampling techniques can be valuable tools to address class imbalance and improve model performance, while being mindful of their limitations."
